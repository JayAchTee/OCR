# OCR

After much research, trial and error, I was able to create a Windows 
command line program that uses the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) OcrEngine.

While this is not a fully developed solution it's enough to get you started if 
you need a simple, fast OCR program on Windows 10 and Windows Server 2012R2.
